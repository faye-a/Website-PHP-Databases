# Website-PHP-Databases
The website was created for an assignment during my course. The website constists of three webpages:
* index.php gives the major product lines available from a database.
* offices.php gives the offices of the company in a tabular format. 
* payments.php provides recent payments and it is display for that customer with it's information.
